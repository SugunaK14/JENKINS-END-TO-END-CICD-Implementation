# JENKINS-END-TO-END-CICD-Implementation
This project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a Java-based application. It covers integration with Maven, SonarQube for code quality, Argo CD for GitOps, Helm for application packaging, and Kubernetes for deployment.

 Spring Boot based Java web application
 
This is a simple Sprint Boot based Java application that can be built using Maven. Sprint Boot dependencies are handled using the pom.xml 
at the root directory of the repository.
